# Horrible Calculator
That's it. This calculator is meant to work horribly, while the UI looks good.

## How does it work
gen.py generates a DBF file with all the operations and answers, and then the actual app reads that DBF file and searches the user's operation instead of just, you know, calculating.

## How to use it
I have no idea why you would like to, but you basically just run a ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Then, generate your DBF file by running ```python3 gen.py``` (Warning! Infinite loop)
Once you're ready, run ```python3 main.py``` and enjoy your super useful calculator.

## Contributing
I will accept basically any PR to be honest, just make sure to write illegible code and do random unneccesary stuff.
